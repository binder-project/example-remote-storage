:books: Same functionality. Better performance for you. :books:

Over the past few months, we've been improving Binder's architecture and infrastructure. We're retiring this repo as it will no longer be actively developed. Future development will occur under the [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/) organization.

* All development of the Binder technology will occur in the [binderhub repo](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub)
* Documentation for *users* will occur in the [jupyterhub binder repo](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binder) 
* All conversations and chat for users will occur in the [jupyterhub binder gitter channel](https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/binder)

Thanks for updating your bookmarked links.

# Example Binder using remote storage

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/binder-project/example-remote-storage)

A Binder-compatible repo that shows accessing data from remote sources.

The notebooks use `boto` and `requests` to load both images and tables from S3 and Google Storage. The image loading makes use of `PIL` and the table loading makes use of `pandas`. In both cases the data have been made publicly available.
